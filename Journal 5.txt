	So today is a great day. I was able to get something really special and I thank a certain person for making this all possible. It must be really hard for that person to get that certain something. Even though I thought that person gave up in looking for that certain something, that person was able to do it. I am very surprise. My roommate is going to be super happy when he sees this thing at the same time he will get very mad at me. I swear my roommate will not make up his mind on whether he is happy or mad/sad. Let's just say he loves it and hates it at the same time. And since I love annoying him, I kept showing him this certain something and because of that certain something he could not sleep at all. It is so funny seeing is unsure reaction. XD
