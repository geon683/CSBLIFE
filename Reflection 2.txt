Frosh Solidarity Night

	A concert/ show/ mass was something I never expected after the day I had my Frosh Orientation. ItÅfs something I donÅft really see in other universities. At that time I was with my friends in Cebu. We were really curios what was going to happen in this ÅgFrosh Solidarity NightÅh. What they never expected, but only I expected, was a mass. It was funny because my friendÅfs friends escape when they heard there was mass. I feel sorry for that poor soul. They miss a lot of fun there. It really just takes one freaking hour. It is nice that Benilde had a mass in Frosh Solidarity Night. It gave me a taste on how holy this school is. It was also cool that the priest was also wearing green. Go Green Archers!
After the mass, we were able to meet our very own President, Br. Victor A. Franco. My impression of him is his too cool to be some kind of priest. Usually old priest would be cranky and grumpy all the time, but Br. Victor is the man.
Then we got some kind of comedy play after Br. VictorÅfs speech. The play was about a group of Frosh people in their first day in Benilde. Even though they were speaking Filipino and I had no idea what they were saying, I understand the story clearly. It was freaking hilarious how they over exaggerate the chaos of a frosh life in Benilde. Thank God I donÅft have that kind of crazy and chaos life here in Benilde. Thumbs up for the people who did the play.
Overall this event was an event I would never forget with my friends in Cebu. It was good way to start college.
