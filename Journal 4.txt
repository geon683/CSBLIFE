	So today I had to memorize my freaking speech in Filipino. I swear this is the hardest thing I have ever experience. My gosh it is hard to say a speech if the language your saying is language you don't even barely use. It sucks that I don't know Filipino. I swear everything would be great if only I knew the language. Aside from the fact that itÅfs hard to speak it, it is also really hard to memorize it. I have to depend of mnemonics to memorize the speech. I swear it is very hard. It's literally memorizing unknown words in the correct order. And there are like 500 plus words! Dear God save me. To be fair I at least try to research on what I am saying. I hope this experience will help me understand more about Filipino.
