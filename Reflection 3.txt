Star Recital 2011

1. What Benildean Core Values have you learned from the STAR Recital 2011 (Shadow Play, Intermediate Acting, Dance and Coro) performances?

	I can say that a lot of the Benildean Core Values were present in the play and these are they strengthen their relationship through transformation of individual work, creativity, social responsibility, professional competence, a sense of nationhood, and faith.

2. What scene/production did you like the most?

	I love the parts when they mostly show the shadow play because I never seen a shadow play that complicated before. It is something I didnÅft expect and that is why I love it. It was also able to give off some kind of emotion to me. ItÅfs rare to see something like that in a shadow play. It was truly brilliant.

3. How does it affect you as a Benildean-Lasallian?

	It affects me in a way that I now know that Benilde has a lot of creative students out there. It makes me proud to be in this school. The play gave me some kind of inspiration to study really hard so that I too can make something as awesome as that. They are very creative and that is something I want to improve.

4. Among the core values, what struck you the most based from the production that you watched?

	The fact that this was very creative is the one that struck me. I never imagine seeing so much colorful effects in that show. Who knew you can actually make multiple effects in shadow play.

5. Give a short reflection from the production that you have seen?

	The whole point of the story was about family. In order for us to make a family work is that we must be one. Family is the most important thing in the world and we must strive to get along because we would be living together as long as we live. And when a love one is lost we must strive even harder so that person who died would be very proud. A lost of a person isnÅft the end of your world.
