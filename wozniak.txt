How can I apply Wozniak's system for myself and for this?

	The best way for me to apply this well is to plan a study schedule in a way that it follows the algorithm technique smoothly. I have to make sure that if I am going to do this properly I need to study very early so that I can be able to make the required days to remembering the lesson before a big quiz or an exam. I could also check and keep track what I have learn two or seven days ago and try review it again so that I would be able to remember this without forgetting.
