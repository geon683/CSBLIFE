	I am now a college student and no longer a high school student which means a lot of new things going to happen. Since I am now taking up BS-IT GDD, my new role is to be the one of the top Philippine representatives in the video game industry. I will show the world that Filipinos have awesome skills in programming, creativity, and making really good and unique games. But to achieve that I would need to work hard. In order to do that, I have to find time for my studies and programming training. So that means I need to have a different routine now that my training serious. No more playing games and surfing in the net for awhile for me.
	
	These changes will probably effect the relations I have with others. They might not like the new me, but that would also leave more room to people who will like the new me. Having friends is a must for me. They help you in the times you need them the most.
	
	Overall I am assuming that I would probably have tough time here in college. But challenges are always there and I am pretty sure I will make it. I probably fail in making my first video game. Failure always happens even to great people. They became great not only because they succeed in many things but also because they were able to stand again when they failed countless of times. You cannot succeed unless you tried failing first. Otherwise I would know the flaws of the game I failed.
