Frosh Orientation

	I remember the Frosh Orientation as if it was yesterday. I remember entering the school and I felt the atmosphere of college everywhere. There were a lot people coming in and they were all greeted by the sound of the drummers from the pep squad and a few of the upper-class people saying "Welcome Frosh". I was very thrilled to see my blockmates. So when I arrived in the theather where the orientation was at, I was told sit over group of people. At first I thought these were my blockmates, but it turns out that they put me at the wrong section. So when I actually was able to sit with my real blockmates, I was eager to talk to them. But that time I was kind of shy so I just waited until I felt adjusted. I remember that people orienting were really awesome and funny. They really made my day. I thought orientations were boring, but these guys prove me very wrong.

The point of the orientation was to unite the blocks into one and learn the basic things of our new school. What the people orienting did to make the orientation work was to mix the orientation with a lot of fun. So to the people orienting had to make special games for us to play. Even though our block never won anything, I had a really good time. I am very thankful with that event because it really helps me prepare for what was coming in college and made me able to understand more about my blockmates.
