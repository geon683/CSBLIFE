	I am so happy today since I am glad to be able to make friends with a certain someone. Finally someone who is awesome at the same time lives in Cebu. I swear I kind of feel alone without any Cebuanos around. It is just not right. This is my first time staying alone away from my home town. The experience is nice, but sometimes I wish I never had it. But still... Manila is awesome and many things have change. I hope this new friend of mine feel the gap the loneliness in my heart. Friends are something I want and love. Without friends, I just don't what to do. Friends are always there when you need them the most and that is why friends are very important. I hope through this person I may also find other new friends too.
