	So today, I spent my days like every usual normal everyday-life day I always have, but this one has a twist.  In my CSBLIFE today, we had a quiz like usual. I have to admit I was kind of cramming on that day because of a certain someone who kept disturbing me about a certain person. So I was expecting to get kind of a low grade. But the problem is it went beyond my expectations. The first ten questions blew my mind. I could not recognize what sir was talking about. Until I realize that I miss a module to study. I could say I was in a state of shock while I was taking the quiz. I could have guess the answer, but I couldn't because I was that shock. I could have gotten higher if I had guessed at least the ones I left blank. It was kind of easy to guess them because they were kind of common sense.

	Next time I'm going to have to study that certain module I left out. I truly need that listening skill because you can say I really really need that skill.
