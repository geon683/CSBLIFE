"I must do the work of God, and if the worst should come to pass, we shall have to beg alms."

Saint John Baptist de La Salle quoted this when he gave up his fortune to make the school that we are now. His work form God is something you have to admire. He knows that though bad things may happen after giving up his fortune, in the end it will be worth it because he is doing it for charity and for God. He is ready to face those bad things. He puts God first out of everything. Bad things happen to everybody whether you are rich or poor, ugly or handsome, fat or thin bad things happen. It's a part of everyday life whether you like it or not. But things happen and it can slowly pass by. But when working with God for charity, love, and mercy you begin see that you need to suffer in order for good things to happen. If de La Salle never gave up his fortune to the poor, then  the whole program to the poor and the La Salle Schools would have never existed and I wouldn't be here today to right this awesome reflection about him. The pains of one's sacrifice are never in vain. There is always reward in something you do. Though some people may not notice it, but it will truly happen. For La Salle case, he was rewarded by something he never imagined. What he lost was repaid by unimaginable boundaries.
