	Wohoo! For the first time ever I watch a PBA game. And it's not any ordinary PBA game it was the Finals Game 6. Honestly I am not really much of a basketball fan, but the atmosphere of the game was so lively. So much people cheering and shouting. The players gave it their best shot in playing the game. It was just an experience I never had. If only the team I wanted to win actually won at the game. The only reason why I wanted them to win is because one my friends from Cebu are for that team and two if they win, they win the finals. That means the balloons and confetti  will start pouring out everywhere. I wanted to see that. I paid good money to see balloons and confetti (Actually I got the tickets for free). I am not joking. I am dead serious. All it matters in the end is that I had the experience now of watching a PBA Final game.
