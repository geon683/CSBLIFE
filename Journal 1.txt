	So today I have to say that I am improving in the program called Alice. I knew Alice was going to be a piece of cake and I am very glad that I can easily learn this program. I was wrong about this program for being very boring to use. I had so much fun messing around with all the stuff in Alice. It made me want to explore and find out how far Alice can make cut scenes. Maybe the reason why I didn't like Alice before is because it looks really cheap. When I mean cheap, I mean that there was no animations and very limited commands. But because I was messing with it, I found out that I can move each and every individual parts of the body of any object I put in like the legs, arms, hands, feet, etc.

	So I tried experimenting a bunny and see if I can make it hop with ok animation. There was no hopping animation so I had no make my own. So I had to rotate its legs first and then while that happens I had to make it move one meter above and forward. At first I had a problem because it would not go down and instead stayed in the air. I wanted it to jump forward and then land back. It took some time for me to figure it out and what I did was to make the next set of animation the reverse version of the one I did. The result was a success.
