1) Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reason for failing?
	
	Of course I failed in an exam before. Who has never tried failing at least one exam? No one. I usually fail because either I lack effort, get lazy, get distracted, or the subject is hard like Filipino.

2) For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highst score in an exam?

	I did not answer this because I am not a perfect human being.

3) How was your first experience of DLS-CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? What are you going to do again for the DLS-CSB Finals?

	I can say that it is different from high school. I like it a lot better than the one in high school. The test are finally done in the computers. Thank God that I don't have to write any more. Doing a test has never been so comfortable in my life. I wish they can do this with all the other exams. I like that some of the test are similar the high school exams. I can still apply the techniques I do in high school.
	Since I now know how test works, I'm going to be so prepared for the finals. I'm confident that I can do better in the finals. I just hope I don't get too confident.
