Topic: In-Game Tutorial Decisions

     I found this question very interesting because I was intrigue about the video game designers' opinion on tutorial modes in games.Now the answer they give this guy is something very useful for me. One guy pointed out that instead of making a tutorial mode, which would be tiresome to program, he can make the level cleverly design to teach you how to use the character's ability without even letting you know. Now he gave an example with the game Portal where in the first level was design to be plain a simple. But when the level progress the game add variarity and the level of difulty changes so that the player will be able to find new ways to use that ability. By doing this, the player will be able to learn the games mechanics without ruining the flow of gameplay. If there are still tutorial modes some players would just want to skip it all the time because they just want to play the game. I was also able to find this article too http://www.auntiepixelante.com/?p=465.
